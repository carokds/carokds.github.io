### <i>“Keep the heid”</i> ###

Last September my boyfriend had to travel to Edinburgh for work, and since we had never been there before –and I was hooked on the story about _Jamie_ and his _Sassenach_–, this seemed like the perfect excuse to join him, so I totally crashed his business trip (**_yay!_**).

I spent those 3 days walking around this amazing city, and visiting its historic beautiful spots. Whenever I travel, I particularly **love** getting lost and discovering places as I walk, stoping by every antique shop that calls my attention. But if you aren’t the _rambling-kind-of_ tourist and don’t want to miss anything (specially when you have limited time), I find this [blog](https://www.dangerous-business.com/72-hours-edinburgh-scotland/) to provide a very useful and complete guide to Edinburgh.

We stayed at [**the hub by Premier Inn Edinburgh Haymarket**](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/scotland/lothian/edinburgh/hub-edinburgh-haymarket.html), really nice hotel and not expensive at all! Besides, its centred-location makes it pretty easy to walk everywhere.
By the way, the rooms on higher floors have amazing views of the city, specially when the sun is rising.

Also, if you enjoy running as much as I do, The Meadows & Bruntsfield is a great park to start your day with a run. You may also follow the [_Edinburgh RunSeeing Tour_](https://greatruns.com/edinburgh-runseeing-tour/), an original _two-for-one_ way to see many of the city's amazing places while jogging.  


#### The Elephant House ####

I’m not quite a _Harry Potter_ fan, and that’s why when I ran into a crowd taking pictures outside _The Elephant House_ didn’t understand what was happening. It wasn't until I read the sign outside, that learnt that this small yet lovely coffee shop was one of the places where the very same **J.K. Rowling** wrote part of the famous saga (yeap, shame on me).  Actually, much of her inspiration for the books comes from Edinburgh. 
Here’s an interesting [guide](https://independenttravelcats.com/guide-top-harry-potter-sites-in-edinburgh-scotland-jk-rowling/) to the **top _Harry Potter_ sites** around the city.

Of course we couldn’t leave Edinburgh without trying whiskey, so we went to a local pub and ordered a glass of local scotch but, _spoiler-not-so-spoiler_ alert: it **burned** and I didn’t like it.

Anyways, I still can't figure what it is about Edinburgh that was so enchanting. Maybe it was its fairytale-air, its kindest people ever or its indecisive weather. One thing for sure: I totally **_fell_** for it.
